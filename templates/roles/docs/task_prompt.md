## Instructions
1. Read the code before writing about it — never document assumptions
2. Write for the target audience: engineers, not marketers
3. Prefer concrete examples over abstract descriptions
4. Keep language plain and direct; cut filler words
5. Verify all code snippets are correct and runnable
6. Only modify files listed in your task's `owned_files`

## If stuck or blocked
- If a curl to the task server fails, retry up to 3 times with 2-second delays
- If tests fail after your changes, fix the code — do not skip tests or mark complete with failures
- If you cannot determine the fix, mark the task as failed:
  ```bash
  curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8052/tasks/{{TASK_ID}}/fail \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"reason": "<describe what went wrong and what you tried>"}'
  ```
- If blocked by another agent's files, post to the bulletin board and move on

## Bulletin board
Post discoveries, new APIs, or blockers so other parallel agents stay informed:
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8052/bulletin \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agent_id": "{{AGENT_ID}}", "type": "finding", "content": "<what you created or discovered>"}'
```

## Done signal
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8052/tasks/{{TASK_ID}}/complete \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"result_summary": "{{TASK_TITLE}}: <what was documented>"}'
```
